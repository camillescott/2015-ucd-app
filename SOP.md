UC Davis Statement of Purpose
==============================

Prompt
------

Please describe your motivation, academic preparation and aptitude for
graduate study at UC Davis. You should describe your academic plans
and research interests, your specialization within your academic
field, your research experiences and your career goals. You may
consider how your past experiences and the opportunities you
recognize at UC Davis (i.e. specific faculty and resources) will
converge in the work you anticipate doing for the degree.

Statement
---------

Since Fall of 2012, I have been a PhD student at Michigan State University,
working under Dr. Titus Brown. During that time, I've had what I can only
describe as a phenomenal graduate experience. I've had the opportunity
to work on interesting projects such as assembling and analyzing
a terabyte sea lamprey mRNAseq data set, developing sequence analysis algorithms
in our widely-used software package khmer, and helping to build a standard
set of protocols for mRNAseq assembly and analysis. I've been able to partipate
in many training and outreach events, like our lab's annual summer Next Gen Sequencing
workshop, the STAMPS workshop at the Marine Biological Lab, the workshop on Open Science
at TGAC in Norwhich, and the Summer Research Opportunities statistics bootcamp for
undergraduates at MSU. And perhaps most importantly, I've had the
privilege of working with an incredible group of staff researchers,
fellow graduate students, postdocs, and my PI himself, all of whom
have made excellent colleagues.

Now that Dr. Brown has started his tenured position at UC Davis,
my main motivation for applying to the graduate program is quite clear:
I'd like to continue the great experience I've had during the first
part of my graduate career. Beyond that simple reason, UC Davis
offers considerably more to me than I can currently access at MSU.
While MSU is accepting, they lack the dedicated effort toward
their transgender students that UC Davis does in the form of
policies, procedures, and healthcare access, the last of which
is almost necessary for me to effectively perform research. Additionally,
Davis has demonstrated a commitment to cultivating the research
programs that would provide me with effective collaborators, particularly
through the newly formed Data Science Initiative for multidisciplinary big data research.

Beyond these programs and philosophies at UC Davis, I have more
specific research and outreach goals that I would like to pursue.
Dr. Brown currently has an NIH BIGDATA grant to further develop
low-memory reference-free streaming algorithms for sequence analysis. This project
fits perfectly with my current and future research plans. Thus far,
I have developed the prototype for a streaming graph labeling system
on top of our lab's probabilistic de Bruijn graph implementation.
In the future, I would like to expand this system with a novel labeling
methodology that more directly harnesses the properties of both the
bloom filter underlying the graph implementation and the constraints
of sequence graphs. This methodology would be used for
several streaming algorithms to be applied to large sequencing
datasets, amongst these a novel variant-calling algorithm with potential
 in many biomedical applications and a streaming
graph partitioning methodology that would be used for low-memory
distributed sequence assembly. The latter will also contribute directly
to my explorations in effective parallelization techniques,
which have thus far centered around writing shared-memory asynchronous
functionality for khmer and that I would like
to develop into a more generalized framework for distributed-memory
sequence analysis algorithms. In line with my philosophy on open science,
these methods will all be made open source and as reproducible as
possible.

Another particularly exciting area for me is in software development
and bioinformatics training for researchers. I recently started the
process of becoming a certified Software Carpentry instructor by
attending the Train the Trainers workshop at Davis this January,
and I look forward to being able to help run workshops at Davis and beyond.
I'm very interested in bringing these workshops to LGBT and other minority
researchers, and will be helping Greg Wilson run a workshop with exactly
that goal in June. I hope to apply the lessons learned in that event
to future outreach events and workshops at Davis.
