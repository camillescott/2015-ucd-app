When I started graduate school in 2012, I was outwardly a relatively
standard student: good grades, some research experience, some
teaching experience, an interest in the burgeoning field of
bioinformatics, a 21 year old man. I was also undeniably privileged:
my family was upper-middle class,
I had gone to a private college on a full ride and left with no debt,
and my parents, one with a master's degree and the other with a
bachelor's, were very supportive of my plans to attend graduate school.
After being awarded my fellowship at Michigan State University, I was on
pretty much the ideal track.

Internally, however, I had been privately struggling with my gender identity
for many years. A year into graduate school, I came out as transgender,
and began down the path to transition. This was, to put it mildly,
a shock to my otherwise "normal" graduate experience. After a few
months, I transitioned full-time; on the way back from teaching
a graduate metagenomics workshop with my advisor, I very conspicuously
read Julia Serano's "Whipping Girl" to prime him, and came out
to him and all my colleagues a week later. This was terrifying
and raw, but it went well, and everyone was accepting -- a surprise
to me, the best I could ask for. But one thing was unavoidable.
Suddenly, I was a minority in STEM, computer science no less, which
changed everything.

Even with the support of my colleagues, I felt alone. Computer
science isn't exactly a field overflowing with women, and STEM
as a whole has no overabundance of trans women. Most of all,
I wished I had encountered other trans women earlier; had I been exposed to women
who could act as role models, I might have been saved a great deal
of despair and self doubt. So, within a few months, I made a
decision:  I wasn't going to hide. I posted
an entry on my professional blog about trans women in science, and publicly
identified myself as a trans researcher. My hope is that being open about my
identity will encourage other potential trans researchers to pursue
their dreams, and have a little less fear in the process; that they too might
enjoy the benefit of perspective that being a trans researcher offers.

Similarly, I adamantly believe in open source, and open science, as a
guiding philosophy for all research. Often times,
LGBT and other minority groups lack access to basic information --
information about themselves, as in my case,
information about how to move forward in their fields,
information on how to access resources,
and basic access to the information in publications. The same way that
being open about my personal history provides information
to potential trans researchers about themselves, being open about my
scientific process through reproducible papers, open data,
and publicly licensed source code provides accessible information
to those potential researchers about the practice of their field. Aside from
my interest in computing, the opportunity to implement this philosophy is a large
part of my desire for graduate education: our work on streaming algorithms in the khmer project makes sequence analysis
accessible on the most basic equipment, our software is freely and openly remixable, and our work
on open bioinformatics protocols makes the analysis process itself an accessible resource.

Of course, the most direct way to reach people is to teach them. I've taught
in a number of different contexts in the past: as an undergraduate TA for intro programming,
as a lead TA, in several bioinformatics workshops, and for STEM outreach.
I've recently gone through the training to become a Software Carpentry (SWC)
instructor, and will be completing the final steps shortly.
I'll be working with the SWC director, Greg Wilson, to run
a programming workshop targeted at women, people of color, and
LGBT people this June; my own identity allows me to more effectively reach those
who have overcome similar obstacles themselves, and I hope to do more such work at UC
Davis.
