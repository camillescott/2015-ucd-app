Please describe how your personal background informs your decision
to pursue a graduate degree. Please include any educational,
familial, cultural, economic, or social experiences, challenges,
community service, outreach activities or opportunities relevant
to your academic journey; how your life experiences contribute to
the social, intellectual, or cultural diversity within your chosen
field; and/or how you might serve educationally underrepresented
segments of society with your degree.

Statement
----------

When I started graduate school in 2012, I was outwardly a relatively
standard student: good grades, some research experience, some
teaching experience, an interest in the burgeoning field of
bioinformatics, a 21 year old man. I was also undeniably privileged:
My family was upper-middle class,
I had gone to a private college on a full ride and left with no debt,
and my parents, one with a master's degree and the other with a
bachelor's, had a not-quite explicit expectation that I would
continue on to grad school (needed, of course, to balance out
my free-spirited sister's choice of art school). After getting
my research assistantship at Michigan State University, I was on
pretty much the ideal track. This went on a for a year; I was the
lead TA for CSE101 at MSU, helped out with some graduate workshops
in bioinformatics, did some STEM outreach through MSU's undergraduate
summer research program SROP, and began on my research.

Unfortunately, and invisibly, I had been struggling internally
for many years. A year into graduate school, I came out as transgender,
and began down the path to transition. This was, to put it mildly,
a shock to my otherwise "normal" graduate experience. After a few
months, I transitioned full-time; on the way back from teaching
a graduate metagenomics workshop with my advisor, I very conspicuously
read Julia Serano's "Whipping Girl" to prime him, and came out
to him and all my colleagues a week later. This was terrifying
and raw, but it went well, and everyone was accepting -- a surprise
to me, the best I could ask for. But one thing was unavoidable.
Suddenly, I was a minority in STEM, computer science no less, which
changed everything.

Even with the support of my colleagues, I felt alone. Computer
science isn't exactly a field overflowing with women, and STEM
as a whole has no overabundance of trans women. And most of all,
I wished I had encountered other trans women earlier, and come
to terms with myself before turning 23; had I been exposed to women
who could act as role models, I might have been saved a great deal
of despair and self doubt. So, within a few months, I made a
decision: even though I'm lucky enough to avoid most awkward
conversations about trans issues, I wasn't going to hide. I posted
about my thoughts on my professional blog, and was thus publicly
known as a trans researcher. My hope is that being open about my
past will encourage other potential trans researchers to pursue
their dreams, and have a little less fear in the process; that they too might
enjoy the benefit of perspective that being a trans researcher offers.

Similarly, I adamantly believe in open source, and open science, as a
guiding philosophy for all research. Often times, the thing
LGBT and other minority researchers lack access to is information --
information about themselves, as in my case,
information about how to move forward in their fields,
information on how to access resources,
and basic access to the information in publications. Much like how
being open about my personal history provides information
to potential trans researchers about themselves, being open about my
scientific process through reproducible papers, open data,
and publicly licensed source code provides accessible information
to those potential researchers about the practice of their field.

Of course, the most direct way to reach people is to teach them. I've taught
in a number of different contexts in the past: as an ungrad TA for intro programming,
as a lead TA, in several bioinformatics workshops, and for STEM outreach.
I've recently gone through the training to become a Software Carpentry (SWC)
instructor, and will be completing the final steps shortly.
I'll be working with the SWC director, Greg Wilson, to run
a programming workshop targeted at women, people of color, and
LGBT people this June, and I hope to be able to continue such work
at UC Davis.
